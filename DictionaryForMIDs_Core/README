# Instructions

Checkout the source of the core project. The setup is a little tedious as the core project is currently only available via SVN.


```
cd DictionaryForMIDs_Core
git svn clone -r686 https://svn.code.sf.net/p/dictionarymid/code/ --trunk=trunk/DictionaryForMIDs/ .
```

(You might need to get a later version, check https://sourceforge.net/p/dictionarymid/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/DictionaryForMIDs/ to find the latest version on the last commit in src)
